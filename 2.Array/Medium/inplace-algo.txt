## Inplace has two definitons:

STRICT definition is ->
An in-place algorithm is an algorithm that does not need an extra space and produces an output in the same memory 
that contains the data by transforming the input ‘in-place’. However, a small constant extra space used for variables 
is allowed.

// EXAMPLES ->
Bubble sort, Insertion sort, etc.. ( extra space nhi lete, given array ko hi update kar dete hai O/P me )


BROAD definition is ->
In-place means that the algorithm does not use extra space for manipulating the input (jo bhi manipulation hai given
i/p memory me hi ) but may require a small though non-constant extra space for its operation. 
Usually, this space is O(log n), though sometimes anything in O(n) (Smaller than linear) is allowed.


// EXAMPLES ->
Quick sort  ( extra space required is not used to manipulate input, but only for recursive calls. )

Q. Merge sort is not IN-PLACE ?
Ans : Extra Space ( O(n) ) made by recursive calls is done to manipulate the I/P
